If a Windows or Mac user pulls (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in .git/hooks may be run, which results in the attacker's commands being executed. Version control systems used by responding developers:\\nThe UK IT jobs website itjobswatch.co.uk reports that as of late September 2016, 29.27% of UK permanent software development job openings have cited Git,[100] ahead of 12.17% for Microsoft Team Foundation Server,[101] 10.60% for Subversion,[102] 1.30% for Mercurial,[103] and 0.48% for Visual SourceSafe.[104]\\nExtensions[edit]\\nThere are many Git extensions, like Git LFS, which started as an extension to Git in the GitHub community and is now widely used by other repositories. It is currently used for backing projects as a SQL interface for Git code repositories[75] and providing encryption for Git.[76]\\nThe Dulwich implementation of Git is a pure Python software component for Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.[77]\\nThe libgit2 implementation of Git is an ANSI C software library with no other dependencies, which can be built on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and BSD.[78]\"}\n"
